# Assignment 2

This assignment consists of two Python scripts that demonstrate basic control structures and arithmetic operations. The scripts are:

- `task_1.py`
- `task_2.py`

---

## Task 1: `task_1.py`

**Functionality:**

This script defines a function `iseven(a)` that checks whether a given integer `a` is even or odd. It takes input from the user, passes it to the function, and prints whether the number is even or odd based on the function's return value.

### How it works:

- The function `iseven(a)` uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the number is divisible by 2.
- If the number is even, the function returns `0`; otherwise, it returns `1`.
- Based on the return value, the program prints whether the number is even or odd.

## Task 2: `task_2.py`

**Functionality:**

This script calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

### How it works:

- A loop iterates from 1 to 50 (inclusive).
- Each number is added to a cumulative result stored in the variable `res`.
- Finally, the sum is printed to the console.
