# Assignment 3

This assignment contains two Python scripts that perform basic mathematical operations based on user input.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Task 1 - Factorial Calculation (`task_1.py`)

### Description
This script computes the factorial of a given non-negative integer using an iterative approach.

### How It Works
- A function `fact(a)` is defined to calculate the factorial:
  - If `a` is 0 or 1, it returns 1.
  - Otherwise, it multiplies all integers from 2 to `a`.
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- The script outputs the factorial of the entered number.

# Task 2 - Mathematical Operations (`task_2.py`)

## Description
This Python script performs basic mathematical operations using the `math` module. It asks the user to input a number and computes:

- Square root
- Natural logarithm (base *e*)
- Sine (interpreted in radians)

---

## Functionality

1. **Input:**
   - Prompts the user to enter an integer.
2. **Processing:**
   - Calculates:
     - Square root using `math.sqrt()`
     - Logarithm using `math.log()`
     - Sine using `math.sin()`
3. **Output:**
   - Displays the results on the console.
