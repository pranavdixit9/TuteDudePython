### Assignment 1
This assignment contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic arithmetic operations and string manipulation using functions and user input.

Files:

## task_1.py
This script performs four basic arithmetic operations using user-defined functions:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Functionality:
Prompts the user to input two numbers.

Applies the four arithmetic operations using the following functions:

add(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.

sub(a, b): Returns the difference between a and b.

multi(a, b): Returns the product of a and b.

div(a, b): Returns the quotient of a divided by b.

Displays the results of each operation to the user.

## task_2.py
This script demonstrates the use of string manipulation and function definition.

Functionality:
Prompts the user to input their first name and last name.

Combines the names using the greet(fname, lname) function:

greet(fname, lname): Concatenates the first and last name with a space in between and prints a welcome message.
